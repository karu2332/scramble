## Scramble
Scramble is a multi-player word game that utilizes various Node.js libraries,
such as Express.js, SOCKET.IO, and EJS. All players are given the same seven
letters at the same time. They compete to find the most 3-7 letter words in
30 seconds. There is no limit to the number of rounds. Players can play
the game for as long as they like.
